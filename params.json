{"name":"Claudia","tagline":"Simple python library to read output from the Cloudy astrophysical plasma physics code","body":"Claudia is a simplistic python library for reading Cloudy output files\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nIn this example, we read in a Cloudy model called `testmodel`, and then plot the emissivity of the HÎ±  and [O I] lines as a function of the neutral hydrogen fraction. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom claudia import CloudyModel\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nm = CloudyModel(\"testmodel\")\r\n\r\nplt.plot(m.ovr.HI, m.ems.H__1__6563A, label=\"H alpha\")\r\nplt.plot(m.ovr.HI, m.ems.O__1__6300A, label=\"[O I] 6300\")\r\nplt.xlabel(\"Neutral hydrogen fraction\")\r\nplt.ylabel(\"log_10 (Emissivity)\") \r\nplt.savefig(\"testmodel-plot.png\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n# How it works\r\n\r\nThe claudia library consists of a single class, `CloudyModel`, which is optimized for the most common use case, although it does have limited facilities for customization.  It reads all the Cloudy output files into a single structure, which can than be accessed as attributes.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
